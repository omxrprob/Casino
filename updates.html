  <h1>Hello! This will be our updates and ideas section. Have fun!</h1>
  <h2>Obviously, not all of these might get added—but it’s whatever, yk?</h2>

  <h3>1. <strong>Google Firebase</strong></h3>
  <p>Yes, Google Firebase might get added. This means you could log in with Google and have cloud storage.</p>

  <h3>2. <strong>Accounts</strong></h3>
  <p>Accounts might get added too. This means storing your game data will get easier, plus some other features.</p>

  <h3>3. <strong>Leaderboards</strong></h3>
  <p>Leaderboards might also come later, so you can follow people, see their games, and compete to reach the top!</p>
